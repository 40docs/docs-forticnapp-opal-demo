Not interested in following along with the full guide and just want a working demo of FortiCNAPP OPAL?

!!! tip "Practical Demo Available"
    We've condensed the examples in this lab into a ready-to-run GitHub repository:

    ðŸ”— [lab_forticnapp_opal GitHub Repo](https://github.com/40docs/lab_forticnapp_opal)

    This includes:
    - Pre-built `metadata.yaml` and `policy.rego`
    - Ready-to-use `pass/` and `fail/` Terraform test cases
    - Directory structure compatible with the CLI

To test it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/40docs/lab_forticnapp_opal.git
cd lab_forticnapp_opal/policies
lacework iac policy test -d opal/sample_custom_policy
```

!!! note
    This skips the setup wizard and lets you see policy test results immediately.
